    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>A fantastic way to enjoy lasagna without all the fuss! I thought using frozen ravioli already filled with cheese instead of layering layers of noodles and cheese would make a great dish so easy. It all comes together; just scoop it out, serve with a salad, and enjoy.</p>
    <h1>Ingrediants</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound Italian turkey sausage, casings removed</li>
        <li>2 cups chopped onions</li>
        <li>2 cups sliced fresh mushrooms</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>4 cups chicken broth</li>
        <li>1 (15 ounce) can tomato sauce</li>
        <li>1 (14.5 ounce) can Italian-seasoned diced tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 cup uncooked mafalda pasta</li>
        <li>2 cups chopped fresh spinach</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>Â¼ cup Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>4 teaspoons thinly sliced fresh basil</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef, garlic, garlic powder, salt, and pepper in the hot skillet until meat is browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain and discard grease. Stir pasta sauce, Italian seasoning, basil, and oregano into ground beef mixture.

        </li>

        <li>Ladle a generous layer of meat sauce into the bottom of a slow cooker; add a layer of ravioli. Ladle another layer of meat sauce over ravioli layer; alternate with remaining ravioli and meat sauce until all ingredients are used.

        </li>

        <li>Cook on Low for 3 to 5 hours. Sprinkle ravioli mixture with <strong>mozzarella cheese</strong> and continue cooking until cheese is melted, 45 minutes to 1 hour more.
