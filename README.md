Today I am going to make a basic recipe website.
This  website will consist of basic index page consisting of some authentic dishes and links to that dishes respectively.
This is just a basic website for hands-on practice on HTML.
Foundation course has been very helpful to understand basics of HTML 
and it'll be very clear after doing the asssignment given.
Happy Learning.
